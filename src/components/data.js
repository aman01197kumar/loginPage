The best I could remember were the hugs after every fight. I still feel jealous when you count others as your friends. Might be because I don't care for other and believes only in you. From the time to impress Kriti to the new love story about Jaya and till now to make me kind of perfect as a developer, you were always there to hold my hands and say 'fatega lekin hoga'. I LOVE YOU BRO AND THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU HAVE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS. ",

Maine kisi faltu chiz ke liye kabhi zidd nahi ki aur aapne bhi usko samjha, aur usko saraya. Aapne acchi shiksha, seekh, karmath hokar kaam karna aur sab sehte huye apne na chahne walo me bhi apne liye izzat banana aur bhi chize hai jo aapne sikhayi. Maine ab tak logo ke liye jo bhi kiya ya aage jo bhi karne ki maine thani hai usme aapko apna bhagwan bana kar wo kaam shuru karunga aur puri dridhta ke sath usko ek achhi uplabdhi tak le jaunga.

The attitude of not giving a fuck 'Darte hai kya' about anybody I learned from you. You remember we had a conversation about what would happen after getting separated after college will meet after 5 long years 😂😂😂. I think your unfortunate tongue shows its black magic again🙄😏. Tripling in Scooty wherever we go. Dropping you at Hostel in Dehradun's shivering winters🥶 was one of the most rememberable moments for all of us. You helped in learning several things also and are always a supportive hand to me. THANK YOU!!!",

We judge people around us and let others warn on the basis of our judgment 😂. Most of the time we are correct. But people still consider their experience as their utmost priority until they fucked up with whatever they observed earlier. A belief over me, a reliance of mine on you is actually a great feeling that somebody is there to find a regress decision that might change the vision of fathers, and forefathers. THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME COUNT ON YOU!!!",

      "No words for you. The real implementation of experience I have seen only with you. After college, when I was in dilemma about what to do, should I join the company or follow my own dream? I remember you said me to join and I was like the age limit will expire my dream. You said if you go home, there are challenges you can't imagine. And the result is really horrifying. It's been almost 4 years and took me a long time to get settled on what actually I need to do. I really want to ask you, embrace you for whatever your efforts to make me a better decision-maker. I put the password 'myguru' for the same. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH ME WHENEVER I NEED A GUIDE, A FRIEND, A GURU.  I don't want to discourage you by saying come back soon but only for the thing to hug and say I OWE YOU.",
